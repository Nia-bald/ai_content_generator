Hereâ€™s a complete **To-Do List divided among 2 developers** with a **timeline of 6 weeks**, broken down into **phases** for clarity. The tasks are based on your provided pipeline image. Developer A handles more of the backend/data engineering, while Developer B focuses on content generation, video editing, and uploading.

---

### :technologist: Developer A: Backend / Data Engineering

---

#### **Week 1: Foundation Setup**

* [ ] Set up project repository & environment (Python, DB, Git, venv)
* [ ] Design database schemas:

  * RedditPostTable
  * EngagementTable
  * PostProductionTable
  * VideoTable

#### **Week 2: Reddit Data Pipeline**

* [ ] Build `subreddit finder` (input + selection UI/config)
* [ ] Implement `reddit data collection` using Reddit API (PRAW)
* [ ] Store data in `raw reddit data store`
* [ ] Write to `RedditPostTable` & `EngagementTable`

#### **Week 3: Post Processing & Ranking**

* [ ] Implement `classification algorithm` for filtering useful posts
* [ ] Build `ranking algorithm of post` using metrics (upvotes, views, comments, etc.)
* [ ] Store ranked post in `PostProductionTable`

---

### :technologist: Developer B: Video Generation & Uploading

---

#### **Week 1: Infrastructure & Tools**

* [ ] Set up text-to-speech engine (e.g., ElevenLabs, TTS, gTTS)
* [ ] Install moviepy / ffmpeg or preferred video editing stack
* [ ] Prepare basic UI/config file for content parameters

#### **Week 2: Channel & Video Setup**

* [ ] Build `channel finder` logic (e.g., based on topic/theme)
* [ ] Implement `video downloader` for finding relevant stock/YouTube clips
* [ ] Apply `classification algorithm` on videos (e.g., NSFW filter, tags)

#### **Week 3: Text & Audio**

* [ ] Build `text generator` for each post (title, tags, description)
* [ ] Create `audio synthesizer` module for narration from generated text
* [ ] Save to folder path (connect with DB)

---

### **Week 4: Integration Phase**

:technologist: Developer A:

* [ ] Connect ranking pipeline with post selector
* [ ] Ensure all data flows to DBs and folders correctly

:technologist: Developer B:

* [ ] Implement `video selection algorithm` (clip matching with narration)
* [ ] Build initial `video editing` module with:

  * Narration
  * Captions
  * Stock clips
  * Background music

---

### **Week 5: Testing & Debugging**

* [ ] Test full pipeline from Reddit to edited video
* [ ] Handle edge cases (missing media, low-score posts)
* [ ] Optimize audio/video sync

---

### **Week 6: Finalization & Automation**

:technologist: Developer A:

* [ ] Finalize database integration
* [ ] Clean, optimize, and comment codebase

:technologist: Developer B:

* [ ] Implement `video uploading` to YouTube/Instagram API
* [ ] Generate final metadata (titles, tags)
* [ ] Automate full pipeline (cron job or scheduled runner)

---

### :white_check_mark: Stretch Goals (Optional after Week 6)

* [ ] Web dashboard to view ranked posts & generated videos
* [ ] A/B test different ranking algorithms
* [ ] Add feedback loop (views/likes from YouTube into post ranking)
